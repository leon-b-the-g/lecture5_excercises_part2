#A script that uses the code explained in the lecture to:
	#1. Use the ecoli.txt file and, using the code above as a starting point, make a chart which shows the AT content in a sliding window.
	#The alignment.txt file contains a multiple sequence alignment, one sequence per line. We want to draw a plot of protein conservation based on the alignment similarities, but without using plotcon!

#The code will have to
#1 read in the data
#2 get each coloumn in turn
#3 measure the conservation at each column 
	#what proportion of aa residues are the same
#4 append the measurement to a list
#draw the chart 

#Copying the files I need for the excercise
